LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs).It provides a modular and expressive interface for chaining together LLMs, tools, and other components. Key features include chains for sequential operations, agents for dynamic decision-making with tools, and retrieval for augmented generation. RAG, or Retrieval Augmented Generation, allows LLMs to interact with external data sources like documents or databases, solving issues like hallucinations and outdated information. Vector stores like Chroma and Pinecone are essential for efficient retrieval of relevant document chunks.
